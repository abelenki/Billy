BILLY - Simple invoicing for AppEngine
======================================

Billy is a simple python application for Google's Appengine.
The idea behind billy is to provide a simple web-based application
for invoicing for small businesses and freelancers.

Besides generating invoices it also helps you to keep track of past 
due invoices, and features a generator function for recurring bills.

The project was initiated by me to facilitate my own small business
and to learn using appengine.
